    "Reverse correlation is a technique for studying how sensory neurons respond to various stimuli, in order to understand the relationship between stimulus and neural response. Many neurons are driven by sensory stimulation from the outside world and is in a baseline state in the absence of that stimulation. When presented with an appropriate stimulus, the neuron is either activated above its baseline state of activity or in some cases suppressed below it's baseline. The degree of activation is captured in the neuron's firing rate.\n",
